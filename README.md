# Slash

Simple  remote control, desktop sharing application.

Still very buggy (otherwise everything seems to be working). Lots of refractoring to do.

Todo:
* Only send mouse events when clients mouse is on the capture image (Currently includes whitespace around image)
* Handle disconnects better (Close sockets, after use. join threads that are no longer needed etc,). 
* DRY!
